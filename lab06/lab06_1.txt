Exercise 1:
We want the machine learned model to sort books into genres.

Exercise 2: 
Our ideal outcome is to have all books given to the model sorted into the correct genre.

Exercise 3:
Our success metric is all books are sorted into their correct genre at least 95% of the time. 
Our key results are 
Our ML model is deemed a failure if it sorts a book into an incorrect genre consistently (more than 5% of the time) or does not assign a genre to a given book.

Exercise 4:
The output from our ML model will be a book's title and it's genre in a string, defined as title + genre.

Exercise 5:
The output from the ML model will be made available to the user immediately, with latency allowances up to 10 seconds. 
The outcome will be used for recommending other books within a genre.

Exercise 6: 
If we didn't use ML, we would use heuristics such as 
1. Specific authors always sort into corresponding genres, ex) JK Rowling writes fantasy
2. Given a list of words that appear frequently within each genre, if a certain percentage of those words appear in the book OR if a certain percentage of the words in the book appear in the list, the book will be sorted into that genre.

Exercise 7a:
Our problem is best framed as mutli-class single-label classification which predicts a single specific genre for each book it is given.

Exercise 7b:
Our problem is a binary classification sorting into fiction and non-fiction.

Exercise 8: 
Input 1: author
Input 2: title
Input 3: summary
Input 4: text
Output: genre

Exercise 9: 
The author, title, and summary can be obtained Amazon.com
The full text would need to obtained from Google books (paid resource)

Exercise 10:
The easiest to obtain outputs are author, title, and summary.

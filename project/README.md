   - proposal.ipynb: project proposal in two parts, open in Jupyter notebooks.
   - report.ipynb: project report, open in Jupyter notebooks.
   - showcase.ipynb: prepared materials for the project showcase, open in Jupyter notebooks.
   - updates.ipynb: document listing the project updates made since the walkthrough that occurred on Friday, May 10. Open with Jupyter notebooks.

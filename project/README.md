# Project - The Cut in Prolog
This project works to explore and understand the use of the cut in Prolog programming. Files and their uses are as follows:
   - findRoute.pl: an application of the cut, taken from LPN Exercise 10.4. File contains some suggested queries to test the code in comments. Run with SWI Prolog from the command line.
   - lpn10exercises.pl: a file containing some of the exercises from Learn Prolog Now chapter 10 by Blackburn, Bos, and Striegnitz. File contains some suggested queries to test the code in comments. Run with SWI Prolog from the command line.
   - lpn10practical.pl: a file containing effort towards the exercises from LPN 10.5 Practical Session. Incomplete work, but can be run with SWI Prolog from the command line.
   - proposal.ipynb: project proposal in two parts, open in Jupyter notebooks.
   - report.ipynb: project report, open in Jupyter notebooks.
   - updates.ipynb: document listing the project updates made since the walkthrough that occurred on Friday, May 10. Open with Jupyter notebooks.

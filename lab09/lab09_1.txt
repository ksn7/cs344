Exercise 9.1
  a. Final RMSE of 0.44, which isn't great for a scale of 0 to 1, so linear regression does a rather poor job. Furthermore, the RMSE value barely changes between periods, so it doesn't show a lot of improvement.
 
  b. Both L2 loss and LogLoss are representations of loss, but L2 loss doesn't do a very good job when the output is a probability because misclassifications can appear to be a small mistake because of the scale. On the other hand, LogLoss treats error logarithmically, which will give higher penalty to misclassifications.

  c. The final LogLoss value is 0.53, which appears to be worse, but that reveals that our model isn't doing as well as linear regression would have us believe.

  d. AUC: 0.79; accuracy 0.78 achieved with learning_rate=0.000005, steps=1000, batch_size=30

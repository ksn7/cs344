This module implements the Bayesian network shown in the text, Figure 14.2.
It's taken from the AIMA Python code.

# Compute P(Burglary | John and Mary both call).
# elimination_ask() is a dynamic programming version of enumeration_ask().
# print(elimination_ask('Burglary', dict(JohnCalls=T, MaryCalls=T), burglary).show_approx())
# gibbs_ask() is an approximation algorithm helps Bayesian Networks scale up.
# print(gibbs_ask('Burglary', dict(JohnCalls=T, MaryCalls=T), burglary).show_approx())
# See the explanation of the algorithms in AIMA Section 14.4.

# Compute P(Alarm | burglary but no earthquake)
print("P(Alarm | burglary but no earthquake")
print(enumeration_ask('Alarm', dict(Burglary=T, Earthquake=F), burglary).show_approx())
print("This makes sense, since this is an explicit value in the table.")

# Compute P(JohnCalls | burglary but no earthquake)
print("\nP(JohnCalls | burglary but no earthquake")
print(enumeration_ask('JohnCalls', dict(Burglary=T, Earthquake=F), burglary).show_approx())
print("The high value is correct, since John usually calls if the alarm goes off, and more than likely if the alarm"
      "goes off it is a burglary.")

# Compute P(Burglary | alarm)
print("\nP(Burglary | alarm)")
print(enumeration_ask('Burglary', dict(Alarm=T), burglary).show_approx())
print("This is correct, since there is a chance the alarm went off because of an earthquake or for no reason.")

# Compute P(Burglary | John and Mary both call)
print("\nP(Burglary } John and Mary both call")
print(enumeration_ask('Burglary', dict(JohnCalls=T, MaryCalls=T), burglary).show_approx())
print("John and Mary both calling is already pretty rare, and both have a chance of calling even without the alarm "
      "going off! \nSince there's also the chance that the alarm is going off for a reason other than a burglary, this "
      "isn't very high.")

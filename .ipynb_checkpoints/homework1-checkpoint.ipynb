    "Introspection would not do a good job of informing AI efforts of modelling human cognitive behavior for a number of reasons, the first of which is bias. I believe that it is impossible for a person to examine their own psyche and mental process in an unbiased way. I find it hard to imagine that anyone has truly neutral feelings toward themselves, whether it be liking or disliking, and any non-neutral emotion toward a person introduces bias into their analysis. Furthermore, many mental health professionals will not engage in treatment or examining of anyone they have a personal history with because it is difficult for them to eliminate their bias because of that history. No one has more history with any person other than themself! Because of this unavoidable bias, I don't think any person could examine their own thought process and come out of the situation with an accurate, unbiased account of how it works. It simply doesn't seem possible. \n"

    "A secondary reason that introspection is a bad system to base AI off of is that people are different and they think differently, so even if a person's thought could be correctly analyzed and represented in AI, there's no guarantee that that depiction of a human brain would think and process in a way that is applicable to everyone. There would need to be a different AI for every person, which is an impossible feat. There is simply no way to model the human psyche digitally, especially when powered by introspection."
